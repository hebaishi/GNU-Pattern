Gpat source code
====================

Written by: Ying Xu
Version:    1.01,  4/2004

Description
-----------

Briefly, Gpat is a clone of IBM splash program 
with some alterations. Its full source code is
available  under GNU GPL. It aims at providing users
a basic work to further the research in pattern 
discovery. It finds out maximal patterns from input 
sequences as Teiresias and Splash do. Gpat exists for
freedom of testing new ideas. 
For details, see http://www.gnu.org

Notes
-----

Gpat is a command line program without any graphic 
user interfaces. download the codes from 
	ftp://202.127.18.232/xuying/src 
,decompress the package and compile the program with command 
	"tar -zvxf gpat.tar.gz"
	"gcc -v"   (check gcc version)
	"gcc -o gpat gpat.c ASM1.c -lm -lpthread"
then the executable binary should be in the same directory.
noting that gcc 3.2 or above is needed.

Examples
--------
example 1
	"./gpat -i sars.fasta -o pattern_report1 -t 0 -k 5 -l 8 -s 15 -K 12 -p 6 -w 8 -m 2"

"-i sars.fasta -o pattern_report1" tells Gpat to 
look for patterns from sars.fasta and output the results 
into pattern_report1(by default, the output file is "my_pattern.pat"). 
Since the input file is DNA, type should be 0 ("-t 0"). 
Each pattern is at least 8 letters long and have at least 
5 letters in its text string("-k 5 -l 8"). "-K 12" tells 
that the pattern must also appear at least 12 times in 
the input file. Every seed pattern, from which maximal 
pattern is derived, must appear at least 15 times ("-s 15") 
in the input file. "-m 2" says that two threads are started 
to do the jobs.  

example 2
	"./gpat -i sars.fasta -o pattern_report1 -t 0 -k 5 -l 5 -x"
this command tells Gpat to count the occurences of 
5-letters-long sequences from the input file. "-x" means these 
sequences will not be extented as what happens in splash algorithm. 
The number of minimum tokens in seed must equal to the window size 
with the existence of "-x".

example 3
	"./gpat -h"
it lists the help information.
   "-i input filename                                        input data from file."
   "-o output filename          (default my_pattern.pat)     output to file."
   "-k min tokens in seed       (default 5)                  minimum number of tokens in seed."
   "-l win width of seed        (default 8)                  window width when scanning seed."
   "-s min supports for seed    (default 2)                  minimum supports needed to be a seed."
   "-J min tokens in pattern    (default 1)                  minimum number of tokens in pattern."
   "-K min supports for pattern (default 2)                  minimum supports needed to be reported."
   "-p min percentage covered   (not used)                   minimum percentage of sequences covered by pattern."
   "-w min pattern width        (default 0)                  minimum pattern length that should be gained."
   "-t type sequence type       (default 2)                  dna(0) or extended nucleic acids(1) or protein(2)."
   "-m multi-threaded           (default 1)                  switch to multi-threaded state"
   "-n store-pattern till end   (default 0)                  store pattern information till thread dies"
   "-h --help                                                display this usage information."
   "-v --verbose                                             print verbose messages."
   "-x no extension/quick count                              no extension to achieve quick count(k must equal l)");

attentions in version 1.0
----------
Sequences from input file are put into a temporary file and mapped 
into the process' space using mmap. so if the work is interrupted, 
a temporary file named "iris*" will remain in the "/tmp" directory. 
Cleaning the directory if necessary or it will be filled with junk 
sequences.  

changes in version 1.01
----------
during sparse searching, weird symbols and wrong 
patterns will emergy. these bugs were fixed, and 
this version also removed the dependence on temp
file.
